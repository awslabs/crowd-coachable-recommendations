        Notice: Each question is sent to multiple workers and we use Dawid Skene (DS) consensus
        voting algorithm to find the best answers. We may include some trick options to
        calibrate the DS algorithm to reduce its error rates.
        Notice that, the DS algorithm performs a joint evaluation of worker rating
        (based on consensus with other workers) and task labeling.
        If we find a worker's rating too low, we cannot use the labels and we may
        <strong>reject up to ALL of the payments</strong> depending on the specific conditions.
        For answers which win the DS selection (around 50% of all answers),
        we send out a small bonus as a gesture of our appreciation.
